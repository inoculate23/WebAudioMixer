# Web Audio Mixer
## About
Web Audio Mixer is an online DJ instrument. It allows you to open audio files from your hard drive and blend them using a 
DJ inspired mix board. It's currently live on my website so that you can play with it [here](http://www.tuckerburke.com/Web-Audio-Mixer/).
## Documentation
I initially created this web application for my Rich Media Web App Development course at Rochester Institute of Technology. 
It utilizes HTML for the UI, the web audio API and the canvas API output are programmed using JavaScript. There are a couple 
of features I would still like to add, like pitch adjustment and nudge. These additions would allow for beat matching and would complete 
the tool. Next time around, I would like to create a synthesizer VST plugin.
